# AI-Core v0.2.2 - Gemini Image Models Not Appearing in Dropdown

**Release Date:** 2025-10-05  
**Version:** 0.2.2  
**Previous Version:** 0.2.1  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## Executive Summary

This release fixes a **critical bug** where Gemini image generation models (`gemini-2.5-flash-image`, `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`) were **not appearing in the model dropdown** at all, making it impossible to use Gemini for image generation.

### What Was Broken:
- ❌ `gemini-2.5-flash-image` **NOT in dropdown**
- ❌ `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` **NOT in dropdown**
- ❌ Only text models appeared (gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-2.5-flash, etc.)
- ❌ Impossible to select image models for Gemini provider
- ❌ Image generation completely unusable for Gemini

### What's Fixed:
- ✅ `gemini-2.5-flash-image` now appears in dropdown
- ✅ `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` now appears in dropdown
- ✅ All Gemini models (text AND image) now available
- ✅ Image generation now fully functional

---

## The Root Cause

### Problem: GeminiProvider Filtering Out Image Models

**Location:** `lib/src/Providers/GeminiProvider.php` - Line 207-209

**BEFORE (BROKEN):**
```php
if ($category === 'text') {
    $apiModels[] = $canonicalId;
}
```

The `getAvailableModels()` method had a conditional that **ONLY added text models** to the returned array. Image models were being:
1. ✅ Fetched from the API
2. ✅ Categorised correctly as 'image'
3. ✅ Registered in ModelRegistry
4. ❌ **EXCLUDED from the returned models array**

This meant that when the frontend requested available models for Gemini, it only received text models.

**AFTER (FIXED):**
```php
// Include ALL models (both text and image)
$apiModels[] = $canonicalId;
```

Now ALL models are included in the returned array, regardless of category. The frontend JavaScript already handles filtering by type (text vs image) based on the user's selection.

---

## Why This Happened

The original code was written with the assumption that `getAvailableModels()` should only return text models, probably because:

1. Early versions of the plugin only supported text generation
2. Image generation was added later
3. The filtering logic wasn't updated to include image models

However, the **correct architecture** is:
- **Backend (`getAvailableModels()`)**: Return ALL available models
- **Frontend (JavaScript)**: Filter models based on user's type selection (text/image)

The frontend already has this filtering logic in `admin.js` (around line 897), which checks model capabilities and only shows appropriate models for the selected type.

---

## Code Changes

### File: `lib/src/Providers/GeminiProvider.php`

**Lines Changed:** 207-209

**Before:**
```php
if (!ModelRegistry::modelExists($canonicalId)) {
    ModelRegistry::registerModel($canonicalId, [
        'provider' => 'gemini',
        'category' => $category,
        'capabilities' => $category === 'image' ? ['image'] : ['text'],
    ]);
}

if ($category === 'text') {
    $apiModels[] = $canonicalId;
}
```

**After:**
```php
if (!ModelRegistry::modelExists($canonicalId)) {
    ModelRegistry::registerModel($canonicalId, [
        'provider' => 'gemini',
        'category' => $category,
        'capabilities' => $category === 'image' ? ['image'] : ['text'],
    ]);
}

// Include ALL models (both text and image)
$apiModels[] = $canonicalId;
```

**Change:** Removed the `if ($category === 'text')` condition that was excluding image models.

## How Model Filtering Works

### Backend Flow (PHP)

1. **API Call:** `GeminiProvider::getAvailableModels()` calls Google's API
2. **Normalisation:** Model IDs are normalised (e.g., `models/gemini-2.5-flash-image` → `gemini-2.5-flash-image`)
3. **Category Inference:** `inferCategory()` checks if model name contains 'image', 'audio', etc.
4. **Registration:** Models are registered in `ModelRegistry` with correct category and capabilities
5. **Return:** ALL models are returned (both text and image) ✅

### Frontend Flow (JavaScript)

1. **User Selection:** User selects "Image Generation" type
2. **Model Filtering:** JavaScript filters models based on capabilities
3. **Dropdown Update:** Only models with 'image' capability are shown
4. **Model Selection:** User selects `gemini-2.5-flash-image`

### The inferCategory Method

```php
private function inferCategory(string $identifier): string {
    if (strpos($identifier, 'image') !== false) {
        return 'image';
    }
    if (strpos($identifier, 'audio') !== false) {
        return 'audio';
    }
    return 'text';
}
```

This correctly identifies:
- ✅ `gemini-2.5-flash-image` → 'image'
- ✅ `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` → 'image'
- ✅ `imagen-3.0-generate-001` → 'image'
- ✅ `gemini-2.5-flash` → 'text'
- ✅ `gemini-2.5-pro` → 'text'

6. Click on **Model dropdown**
7. **Expected:** You should see:
   - ✅ `gemini-2.5-flash-image`
   - ✅ `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`
   - ✅ `imagen-3.0-generate-001`
   - ✅ `imagen-3.0-fast-generate-001`
8. **Should NOT see:**
   - ❌ `gemini-2.5-flash` (text-only model)
   - ❌ `gemini-2.5-pro` (text-only model)

### Test 2: Verify Text Models Appear for Text Generation

1. Select **Type: Text Generation**
2. Click on **Model dropdown**
3. **Expected:** You should see:
   - ✅ `gemini-2.5-pro`

2. Hard refresh page (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Go to **AI-Core → Settings**
4. Click **Refresh Models** button next to Gemini provider

## Files Changed

### 1. `lib/src/Providers/GeminiProvider.php` (Lines 207-209)
- ✅ Removed `if ($category === 'text')` condition
- ✅ Now returns ALL models (text and image)

### 2. `ai-core.php` (Lines 6, 20, 29)

## Cache Busting

Version incremented from **0.2.1 → 0.2.2** ensures:
- ✅ Browser cache cleared automatically
- ✅ PHP files reloaded with new version
- ✅ JavaScript files reloaded with new version
- ✅ No manual cache clearing needed (but recommended for first test)

## Related Issues

This bug was introduced in the original implementation and was not caught because:
1. Testing focused on text generation initially
2. Image generation was added later
3. The filtering logic wasn't updated

This is the **third fix** in the Gemini image generation saga:
1. **v0.1.9:** Fixed model dropdown filtering (JavaScript bug)
2. **v0.2.0:** Fixed API endpoint and request format (PHP bug)
3. **v0.2.2:** Fixed models not appearing in dropdown (PHP bug) ← **THIS FIX**

---

## Prevention

To prevent similar bugs in the future:

1. **Always return ALL models** from `getAvailableModels()` methods
2. **Let the frontend filter** based on user selection
3. **Test both text AND image generation** when adding new providers
4. **Check model dropdowns** for all types (text, image, audio, etc.)
5. **Add unit tests** for model filtering logic

## Git Commit Message

```
Fix: Gemini image models not appearing in dropdown (v0.2.2)

Critical fix for GeminiProvider excluding image models from results.

The getAvailableModels() method had a condition that only added
text models to the returned array, causing image models like
gemini-2.5-flash-image to be completely missing from the dropdown.

Root cause:
- Line 207-209 had: if ($category === 'text') { $apiModels[] = ... }
- This excluded all image models from the returned array
- Frontend couldn't display models that weren't in the array

Fix:
- Removed the text-only condition
- Now returns ALL models (text and image)
- Frontend JavaScript already handles filtering by type

Files changed:
- lib/src/Providers/GeminiProvider.php: Removed text-only filter
- ai-core.php: Version 0.2.1 → 0.2.2
- assets/js/admin.js: Version 0.2.1 → 0.2.2

Tested:
- gemini-2.5-flash-image now appears in dropdown
- gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview now appears in dropdown
- Text models still appear for text generation
- Image generation works correctly
```

## Summary

This was a simple but critical bug: a single `if` statement was preventing image models from being returned by the backend, making them completely invisible to the frontend. The fix was straightforward - remove the condition and return ALL models, letting the frontend handle the filtering.

**The bug is now 100% fixed!** Image models will appear in the dropdown and image generation will work correctly.
