## Known Limitations

### Statista Data
- **Issue:** No public RSS feeds available

- **Alternatives:**
  - Use ONS, Eurostat, World Bank APIs for statistics
  - Manual data entry for key Statista statistics
  - Consider paid Statista API access (if budget allows)

### UK Marketing News
- **Issue:** Several UK marketing publications have RSS feed issues
- **Impact:** Lost 5 marketing news sources
- **Alternatives:**
  - Use working sources (HubSpot, Content Marketing Institute, etc.)
  - Web scraping with rate limiting (requires development)
  - Manual curation of key insights

### BigQuery Google Trends
- **Issue:** Requires Google Cloud setup
- **Impact:** May show "Empty" if not configured
- **Solution:** Configure Google Cloud credentials in settings
