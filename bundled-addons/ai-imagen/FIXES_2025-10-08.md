# AI-Imagen Fixes - 2025-10-08

## Version 0.4.5 (Critical Fixes)

### Critical Issues Fixed

#### 1. Prompts Not Being Added to Database
**Issue:** Prompt Library showed "zero prompts installed" even though groups were created. Prompts were never being added to the database.

**Root Cause:** The AI-Core prompts table uses a column named `content`, but the AI-Imagen installation code was trying to insert into a column named `prompt` (which doesn't exist).

**Fix:** Updated `install_templates()` method in `includes/class-ai-imagen-prompts.php`:
- Changed line 112 from `'prompt' => $prompt['prompt']` to `'content' => $prompt['prompt']`
- Removed unused `'model'` field that doesn't exist in the table schema
- Fixed format array to match the correct number of fields (7 instead of 8)

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/includes/class-ai-imagen-prompts.php` (lines 104-121)

**Technical Details:**
```php
// Before (WRONG):
'prompt' => $prompt['prompt'],
'model' => isset($prompt['model']) ? $prompt['model'] : '',

// After (CORRECT):
'content' => $prompt['prompt'],
// Removed 'model' field as it doesn't exist in table
```

#### 2. Duplicate Groups Being Created
**Issue:** Multiple identical groups (e.g., "Educational Content" appearing 7+ times) were being created on each plugin activation or page load.

**Root Cause:** The `install_templates()` function checked if a group existed, but if it did exist and had prompts, it would skip adding prompts but not prevent the group from being created again on subsequent calls.

**Fix:** Added `cleanup_duplicate_groups()` method that:
- Finds all duplicate group names
- Keeps the oldest group (lowest ID)
- Moves all prompts from duplicate groups to the kept group
- Deletes the duplicate groups
- Runs automatically before installing templates

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/includes/class-ai-imagen-prompts.php` (lines 47-95)

**Technical Details:**
- Uses SQL GROUP BY to find duplicates
- Preserves all prompts by reassigning them to the kept group
- Prevents data loss during cleanup

#### 3. Save to Library - Base64 URL Validation Error
**Issue:** "Image URL is required" error when trying to save Base64-encoded images (data URLs) to the WordPress media library.

**Root Cause:** The `esc_url_raw()` function was stripping out Base64 data URLs because they're not valid HTTP/HTTPS URLs. Base64 data URLs start with `data:image/png;base64,` which `esc_url_raw()` considers invalid.

**Fix:** Changed sanitization method in `ajax_save_to_library()`:
- Replaced `esc_url_raw($_POST['image_url'])` with `sanitize_text_field(wp_unslash($_POST['image_url']))`
- This preserves Base64 data URLs while still sanitizing the input
- The `download_image()` method already handles Base64 data URLs correctly (fixed in v0.4.4)

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/admin/class-ai-imagen-ajax.php` (line 231)

**Technical Details:**
```php
// Before (WRONG - strips Base64 data):
$image_url = isset($_POST['image_url']) ? esc_url_raw($_POST['image_url']) : '';

// After (CORRECT - preserves Base64 data):
$image_url = isset($_POST['image_url']) ? sanitize_text_field(wp_unslash($_POST['image_url'])) : '';
```

## Version 0.4.4

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. Scene Builder Prompt Format Improvement
**Issue:** Scene Builder prompt format was verbose and difficult to read.

**Fix:** Updated `generateSceneDescription()` function in `assets/js/scene-builder.js` to use numbered list format:
- Changed from: "Use a 1:1 square canvas. Place the text box..."
- Changed to: "1. Use a 1:1 square canvas. 2. Place the text box..."
- Added sequential numbering to all instructions for better clarity
- Maintained the instruction to not display layout instructions in the final image

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/assets/js/scene-builder.js` (lines 773-838)

#### 2. Save to Library - Base64 Image Support
**Issue:** "Save to Library" button was failing when trying to save Base64-encoded images (data URLs) from providers like Gemini.

**Fix:** Enhanced `save_to_library()` and `download_image()` methods in `includes/class-ai-imagen-media.php`:
- Added Base64 data URL detection using regex pattern: `/^data:image\/(\w+);base64,(.+)$/`
- Implemented Base64 decoding for data URLs before saving to temp file
- Maintained backward compatibility with regular HTTP/HTTPS URLs
- Added proper error handling for Base64 decode failures
- Added validation for empty image URLs

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/includes/class-ai-imagen-media.php` (lines 47-156)

**Technical Details:**
- The function now checks if the URL is a Base64 data URL
- If yes, it decodes the Base64 data and saves it directly to a temp file
- If no, it uses the existing `wp_remote_get()` method to download from URL
- Both paths converge to use `media_handle_sideload()` for WordPress media library integration

#### 3. Version Updates for Cache Busting
**Issue:** Browser caching could prevent users from seeing the latest fixes.

**Fix:** Updated version numbers across all relevant files:
- Main plugin version: 0.4.3 → 0.4.4
- CSS file versions: 0.4.2 → 0.4.4
- JavaScript file versions: 0.4.3 → 0.4.4

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/ai-imagen.php`
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/assets/css/admin.css`
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/assets/css/generator.css`
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/assets/js/scene-builder.js`

**Note:** The plugin already uses `AI_IMAGEN_VERSION` constant for enqueuing scripts and styles, so cache busting is automatic.

### Issues Investigated (No Changes Required)

#### 1. Statistics Page Styling
**Issue Reported:** Lost styling for statistics sections.

**Investigation:** 
- Checked CSS classes in `assets/css/admin.css`
- Confirmed that `.ai-core-stats-grid`, `.stat-box`, `.stat-label`, and `.stat-value` classes are properly defined
- CSS is being enqueued with version number for cache busting
- The styling is present and should be working correctly

**Possible Causes:**
- Browser cache (cleared by version update)
- CSS file not loading due to server/permission issues
- Conflicting CSS from theme or other plugins

**Recommendation:** 
- Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for CSS loading errors
- Verify file permissions on `assets/css/admin.css`

#### 2. Prompt Library Showing Zero Prompts
**Issue Reported:** Prompt Library shows "zero prompts installed" even though groups are created.

**Investigation:**
- Checked Prompt Library rendering in `admin/class-ai-core-prompt-library.php`
- Confirmed that the page uses server-side rendering
- Verified AJAX handlers for getting prompts are properly registered
- The code correctly organises prompts by group and displays them

**Possible Causes:**
- Database tables exist but prompts table is empty (only groups were created)
- Prompts were not imported or created yet
- Database query issue (unlikely as groups are showing)

**Recommendation:**
- Check if prompts actually exist in the database: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wp_ai_core_prompts`
- Try importing prompts using the Import button
- Create a test prompt manually to verify the system is working
- Check for JavaScript console errors that might prevent prompt display

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Scene Builder:**
   - Add text, logo, icon, or image elements to the canvas
   - Verify the prompt preview shows numbered instructions
   - Generate an image and verify the layout instructions are not visible in the output

2. **Save to Library:**
   - Generate an image using Gemini (which returns Base64 data)
   - Click "Save to Library" button
   - Verify the image is saved to WordPress media library
   - Check that metadata is properly attached to the image

3. **Cache Busting:**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Verify all CSS and JavaScript files load with version 0.4.4

4. **Statistics Page:**
   - Navigate to AI Core → Statistics
   - Verify the statistics grid displays properly
   - Check that stat boxes have proper styling and layout

5. **Prompt Library:**
   - Navigate to AI Core → Prompt Library
   - Verify groups are displayed
   - Check if prompts are shown within groups
   - Try creating a new prompt to verify functionality

### Data Persistence on Uninstall

**Question:** Does data get deleted when uninstalling the plugin?

**Answer:** By default, **NO** - all data is preserved. The AI-Core plugin has a setting called `persist_on_uninstall` which is **enabled by default**.

**How it works:**
1. When you uninstall AI-Core, it checks the `persist_on_uninstall` setting
2. If enabled (default): All settings, API keys, prompts, and groups are kept in the database
3. If disabled: All plugin data is deleted including:
   - Plugin settings and API keys
   - Statistics data
   - Prompt library (both groups and prompts tables)
   - All transients and cached data

**To change this setting:**
- Go to AI-Core → Settings
- Look for "Persist Data on Uninstall" option
- Enable = Keep data when uninstalling (recommended)
- Disable = Delete all data when uninstalling

**Files involved:**
- `uninstall.php` - Handles plugin uninstallation
- `ai-core.php` - Creates the `persist_on_uninstall` setting

**Note:** This setting only affects AI-Core uninstallation. Deactivating the plugin does NOT delete any data.

### Deployment Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- No database schema changes required
- No settings changes required
- Users should clear browser cache after update
- **IMPORTANT:** After updating, deactivate and reactivate AI-Imagen to trigger the cleanup and prompt installation

### Known Limitations

1. **Scene Builder Prompt Format:**
   - AI models may still interpret layout instructions differently
   - Some models may ignore positioning instructions
   - Results may vary by provider and model

2. **Base64 Image Handling:**
   - Large Base64 images may cause memory issues
   - No size validation before decoding
   - Consider adding file size checks in future updates

### Future Improvements

1. Add file size validation for Base64 images
2. Implement progress indicators for large image saves
3. Add retry logic for failed image saves
4. Consider adding image compression options
5. Add more detailed error messages for debugging
