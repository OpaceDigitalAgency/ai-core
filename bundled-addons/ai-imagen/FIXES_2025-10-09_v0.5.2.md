# AI-Imagen v0.5.2 - UI/UX Fixes and Improvements
**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Version:** 0.5.2  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview
This update addresses critical UI/UX issues in the AI-Imagen generator interface, focusing on workflow cards, prompt loading functionality, and overall visual improvements.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Workflow Card Text Colour (Purple Background with White Text)
**Issue:** Workflow cards in Use Case, Role, and Style panels had purple backgrounds but text was not white, causing poor contrast and readability issues.

**Fix:** Updated CSS to ensure proper contrast:
- Changed workflow panel description colour to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9)`
- Updated card backgrounds to use `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95)` for better visibility
- Enhanced hover states with proper white backgrounds
- Improved selected state with full white background and shadow

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/assets/css/admin.css` (lines 162-231)

**Result:** Cards now have excellent contrast and are easily readable on the purple gradient background.

---

### 2. ✅ Added Gap Below Workflow Cards
**Issue:** No spacing between workflow card sections and the prompt input area, causing cramped layout.

**Fix:** Added proper spacing:
- Added `margin-bottom: 30px` to `.ai-imagen-workflow-content`
- Added `margin-bottom: 30px` to `.ai-imagen-cards`

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/assets/css/admin.css` (line 177)

**Result:** Clean, breathable layout with proper visual separation between sections.

---

### 3. ✅ Removed "Additional Details (Optional)" Section
**Issue:** Redundant textarea for additional details was unnecessary and cluttered the interface.

**Fix:** Completely removed the section:
- Removed HTML textarea and label from generator page
- Removed JavaScript references to `#ai-imagen-details`
- Removed AJAX parameter `additional_details`
- Increased main prompt textarea from 4 to 5 rows for more space

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/admin/views/generator-page.php` (lines 235-252)
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/assets/js/admin.js` (lines 48-51, 214-224, 668-677)
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/admin/class-ai-imagen-ajax.php` (lines 95-99)

**Result:** Cleaner, more focused prompt input interface.

---

### 4. ✅ Added Prompt Suggestions Display Area
**Issue:** When clicking workflow cards (e.g., "presentations"), related prompts from AI-Core Prompt Library were not being displayed to users.

**Fix:** Created dedicated prompt suggestions area:
- Added new HTML section `#ai-imagen-prompt-suggestions` below workflow cards
- Created comprehensive CSS styling for suggestion items
- Updated JavaScript to populate suggestions in the new area
- Added smooth slide-down animation when suggestions appear
- Implemented click-to-fill functionality with scroll-to-prompt

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/admin/views/generator-page.php` (lines 230-236)
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/assets/css/admin.css` (lines 233-299)
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/assets/js/admin.js` (lines 345-388)

**CSS Features:**
- Card-style suggestion items with hover effects
- Icon indicators (lightbulb dashicon)
- Title and preview text for each prompt
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive grid layout

**Result:** Users can now see and select from relevant prompts when choosing workflow categories.

---

### 5. ✅ Fixed 403 Forbidden AJAX Errors
**Issue:** When clicking workflow cards, AJAX requests to `ai_core_get_prompts` were returning 403 Forbidden errors, preventing prompts from loading.

**Root Cause:** AI-Imagen was not loading the AI-Core admin script, which provides the necessary nonce (`aiCoreAdmin.nonce`) for authenticated AJAX requests to AI-Core endpoints.

**Fix:** Ensured AI-Core admin script is loaded:
- Added conditional enqueue of `ai-core-admin` script on AI-Imagen pages
- Updated JavaScript to prioritise AI-Core nonce over AI-Imagen nonce
- Added error handling for missing nonce

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/ai-imagen.php` (lines 313-316)
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/assets/js/admin.js` (lines 272-288)

**Code Changes:**
```php
// In ai-imagen.php admin_enqueue_scripts()
if (wp_script_is('ai-core-admin', 'registered')) {
    wp_enqueue_script('ai-core-admin');
}
```

```javascript
// In admin.js loadRelatedPrompts()
var ajaxUrl = (typeof aiCoreAdmin !== 'undefined') ? aiCoreAdmin.ajaxUrl : window.ajaxurl;
var nonce = (typeof aiCoreAdmin !== 'undefined') ? aiCoreAdmin.nonce : '';

if (!nonce) {
    console.error('AI-Core nonce not available. Cannot load prompts.');
    return;
}
```

**Result:** AJAX requests now succeed, and prompts load correctly from AI-Core Prompt Library.

---

### 6. ✅ Improved Nonce Handling
**Issue:** Inconsistent nonce usage between AI-Imagen and AI-Core could cause authentication failures.

**Fix:** Standardised nonce handling:
- Always use `aiCoreAdmin.nonce` for AI-Core AJAX actions
- Fallback to `window.ajaxurl` if AI-Core admin object not available
- Added validation to prevent requests without proper authentication

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/assets/js/admin.js` (lines 272-288)

**Result:** Reliable, secure AJAX communication between AI-Imagen and AI-Core.
