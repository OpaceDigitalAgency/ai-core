# AI-Imagen Changelog - Version 0.6.2

## Release Date
2025-10-09

## Critical Fixes

### 1. Fixed "View Generated Prompt" Section Position (Issue #2 - ACTUALLY FIXED)
**Problem**: The "View Generated Prompt" section was appearing ABOVE the Generation Settings instead of at the bottom.

**Root Cause**: The HTML structure had the prompt preview section placed between Scene Builder and Generation Settings (lines 265-305), not after the Generate Button.

**Solution**: 
- Removed prompt preview section from its old position (after Scene Builder)
- Added it back after the Generate Button section (now at lines 317-357)
- Now appears at the very bottom of the left panel, after all settings

**Files Changed**:
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/admin/views/generator-page.php`

**Visual Order Now**:
1. Describe Your Image (textarea)
2. Scene Builder
3. Generation Settings (Provider, Model, Quality, Aspect Ratio)
4. Generate Button
5. **View Generated Prompt** ← NOW HERE AT THE BOTTOM

### 2. Fixed Generate/Regenerate Buttons Staying Disabled (Issue #1)
**Problem**: Buttons remained disabled after image generation due to localStorage quota exceeded error.

**Root Cause**: 
- Base64 image data in localStorage was exceeding browser quota (typically 5-10MB)
- Error in `addToHistory()` was breaking the success callback flow
- Complete callback wasn't being reached, so buttons stayed disabled

**Solution**:
- Wrapped `addToHistory()` in try-catch to prevent errors from breaking generation flow
- Added nested try-catch for localStorage operations
- If quota exceeded, automatically reduces history to 5 most recent images
- If still failing, skips history storage entirely but continues with generation
- Ensures buttons always re-enable even if history fails

**Files Changed**:
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/assets/js/admin.js` (lines 1033-1071)

**Error Handling Flow**:
```javascript
try {
    // Try to save full history (10 images)
    localStorage.setItem('ai_imagen_history', JSON.stringify(history));
} catch (quotaError) {
    // Quota exceeded - reduce to 5 images
    history = history.slice(0, 5);
    try {
        localStorage.setItem('ai_imagen_history', JSON.stringify(history));
    } catch (e) {
        // Still failing - skip history but don't break generation
        console.error('Cannot save to localStorage, skipping history');
    }
}
```

### 3. Fixed Icon Descriptions to Use Dashicons Unicode (Issue #3)
**Problem**: Icon descriptions were ambiguous (e.g., "share icon (curved arrow pointing right)") causing AI to render incorrect icons.

**Root Cause**: 
- Descriptions were generic and open to interpretation
- AI models were guessing what "share icon" meant
- No reference to the actual Dashicons font system

**Solution**:
- Updated icon mapping to include Dashicons Unicode references
- Changed format from generic descriptions to: `"an icon from Dashicons font-family, glyph \f237 (a share icon)"`
- AI models can now render exact Dashicons glyphs using Unicode values

**Files Changed**:
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/includes/class-ai-imagen-generator.php` (lines 390-467)

**Example Mappings**:
```php
'share' => array('unicode' => '\f237', 'desc' => 'share icon (three connected dots forming a network)'),
'heart' => array('unicode' => '\f487', 'desc' => 'heart shape'),
'star' => array('unicode' => '\f155', 'desc' => 'five-pointed star'),
'cart' => array('unicode' => '\f174', 'desc' => 'shopping cart'),
```

**Prompt Format Before**:
```
Add a share icon (curved arrow pointing right) in #000000 colour...
```

**Prompt Format After**:
```
Add an icon from Dashicons font-family, glyph \f237 (a share icon) in #000000 colour...
```

### 4. Fixed Colour Picker Not Visible for Icons (Issue #5)
**Problem**: Colour picker wasn't visible when selecting icons because Element Properties panel started collapsed.

**Root Cause**: 
- Properties panel content was hidden by default (line 468: `$content.hide()`)
- User had to manually click "Expand" to see the colour picker
- Poor UX - not obvious that properties were available

**Solution**:
- Changed behaviour to auto-expand properties content when element is selected
- Colour picker now immediately visible for both text and icons
- Toggle button state updates to show "Collapse" instead of "Expand"

**Files Changed**:
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/assets/js/scene-builder.js` (lines 464-477)

**Behaviour Change**:
- **Before**: Click element → Properties panel appears collapsed → Click "Expand" → See colour picker
- **After**: Click element → Properties panel appears expanded → Colour picker immediately visible

## Technical Improvements

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Prompt Preview Position**:
   - Navigate to AI-Imagen generator page
   - Scroll down - "View Generated Prompt" should be at the very bottom
   - Should appear after the "Generate Image" button

2. **Test Button Re-enabling**:
   - Generate an image
   - Verify buttons re-enable after generation completes
   - Check browser console for any localStorage warnings
   - If quota exceeded, verify history is reduced to 5 images

3. **Test Icon Rendering**:
   - Add a "share" icon to Scene Builder
   - Generate image
   - Verify the icon matches the Dashicons share icon (three connected dots)
   - Check console for prompt - should show "glyph \f237"

4. **Test Colour Picker Visibility**:
   - Add an icon to Scene Builder
   - Click on the icon
   - Properties panel should appear with content expanded
   - Colour picker should be immediately visible
   - Change colour and verify it applies to icon

5. **Test localStorage Quota**:
   - Generate 10+ images to fill history
   - Check browser console for quota warnings
   - Verify generation continues even if history fails

**Chrome/Edge**:
