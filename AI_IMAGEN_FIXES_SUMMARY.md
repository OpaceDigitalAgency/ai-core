# AI-Imagen Fixes Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Version:** 0.4.0  
**Status:** ✅ All Issues Fixed and Committed

---

## Overview
This document summarises all the fixes applied to the AI-Imagen plugin to resolve the reported issues with OpenAI image generation, Gemini models, and the scene builder functionality.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ OpenAI "Invalid value: 'standard'" Error

**Issue:** When using the `gpt-image-1` model, the API returned:
```
Invalid value: 'standard'. Supported values are: 'hd'.
```

**Root Cause:** The `gpt-image-1` model does not support the `quality` parameter at all, but the code was always sending it regardless of the model.

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `lib/src/Providers/OpenAIImageProvider.php`
- Added conditional logic to only include `quality` parameter for DALL-E models
- The `gpt-image-1` model now sends requests without the quality parameter

**Result:** ✅ `gpt-image-1` now works correctly without quality parameter errors

---

### 2. ✅ Gemini Model 404 Errors

**Issue:** The `imagen-3.0-generate-001` and `imagen-3.0-fast-generate-001` models were returning 404 errors.

**Root Cause:** These legacy Imagen models are not available through the current Gemini API endpoint or require different authentication/endpoints.

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/includes/class-ai-imagen-generator.php`
- Removed the non-working legacy Imagen models from the available models list
- Kept only the working `gemini-2.5-flash-image` models

**Result:** ✅ Only working Gemini models are now shown in the dropdown

---

### 3. ✅ Scene Builder Prompt Not Visible

**Issue:** Users couldn't see what prompt text would be generated from their scene layout, making it difficult to understand what the AI would receive.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added a new "Scene Description" preview panel in the scene builder
- Created `updateScenePromptPreview()` method that updates in real-time
- Added CSS styling for the preview panel (blue background, clear visibility)
- Preview updates automatically when:
  - Elements are added
  - Elements are moved
  - Elements are resized
  - Elements are deleted
  - All elements are cleared

**Result:** ✅ Users can now see exactly what text will be added to their prompt

---

### 4. ✅ Element Properties Panel Vanishing

**Issue:** The properties panel would sometimes disappear or flicker when selecting elements in the scene builder.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added null checks and default values for all properties
- Changed animation logic to prevent flickering
- Used conditional showing instead of always animating
- Rounded position/size values for cleaner display
- Improved state management

**Result:** ✅ Properties panel now stays visible and doesn't flicker

---

### 5. ✅ Text/Icon Positioning Not Reflected Correctly

**Issue:** When moving or resizing elements, the changes weren't being properly tracked and the scene description wasn't updating.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `updateScenePromptPreview()` calls after all drag and resize operations
- Improved position tracking with rounded values
- Enhanced scene description generation with percentage-based positioning
- Better visual feedback during operations

**Result:** ✅ All positioning changes are now reflected in real-time in the scene description

---

### 6. ✅ Resize Not Reflecting in Scene Builder

**Issue:** Resize operations weren't updating the scene description or properties panel correctly.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added scene preview update after resize completes
- Rounded width/height values in properties panel
- Ensured resize updates are reflected in both element and properties
- Fixed `stopResize()` to trigger preview update

**Result:** ✅ Resize operations now properly update all UI elements and the scene description

---

### 7. ✅ WordPress Media Uploader Not Working

**Issue:** When clicking "Add Logo" or "Add Image", the WordPress media uploader modal wouldn't open, showing an error that `wp.media` was undefined.

**Root Cause:** The WordPress media library scripts weren't being enqueued on the AI-Imagen pages.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `wp_enqueue_media()` in the admin scripts function
- Added proper script dependencies: `media-upload` and `media-views`
- Ensured scene-builder.js loads after media scripts

**Result:** ✅ WordPress media uploader now works correctly for logos and images
