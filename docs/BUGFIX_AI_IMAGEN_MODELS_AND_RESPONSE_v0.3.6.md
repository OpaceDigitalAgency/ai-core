# AI Imagen Bug Fixes - Version 0.3.6

**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**AI Core Version:** 0.3.1 → 0.3.6  
**AI Imagen Version:** 1.0.2 → 1.0.3 (0.3.5 → 0.3.6)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Testing

---

## Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Model Dropdowns Empty or Incomplete ✅

**Problem:**
- Gemini dropdown was completely empty
- OpenAI only showed `dall-e-3` and `dall-e-2` (missing `gpt-image-1`)
- Models weren't loading correctly from the API

**Root Cause:**
The `get_provider_models()` method in `AI_Imagen_Generator` was trying to fetch models from AI Core's `get_available_models()` API, which returns **text generation models** (like `gpt-4o`, `gemini-2.5-flash`), not image generation models. The method then tried to filter these for image capability, but:
1. Most text models don't have image generation capability
2. The fallback logic only added defaults when the filtered list was completely empty
3. If even one model passed the filter (like `gpt-4o`), the defaults wouldn't be added

**Solution:**
Changed `get_provider_models()` to return a **hardcoded list of known image generation models** for each provider:

```php
// OpenAI image generation models
'gpt-image-1',
'dall-e-3',
'dall-e-2',

// Gemini image generation models (only models with '-image' suffix)
'gemini-2.5-flash-image',
'gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview',
'imagen-3.0-generate-001',
'imagen-3.0-fast-generate-001',

// Grok image generation models
'grok-2-image-1212',
```

**Files Modified:**
- `ai-imagen/includes/class-ai-imagen-generator.php` (lines 89-128)

---

### Issue #2: Image Not Displaying (Empty URL) ✅

**Problem:**
- Image generation appeared to succeed (response.success = true)
- But `image_url` was empty: `"image_url": ""`
- Image preview showed broken image icon
- Console showed: `{image_url: "", attachment_id: null, message: "Image generated successfully!"}`

**Root Cause:**
The OpenAI Image Provider was returning the wrong response structure:

**What it returned:**
```php
[
    'url' => 'https://...',
    'revised_prompt' => '...',
    'size' => '1024x1024',
    'quality' => 'hd',
    'model' => 'dall-e-3',
    'created' => 1234567890,
    'prompt' => '...'
]
```

**What AI Imagen expected:**
```php
[
    'data' => [
        [
            'url' => 'https://...'
        ]
    ],
    'created' => 1234567890,
    'model' => 'dall-e-3'
]
```

AI Imagen's AJAX handler was trying to access `$response['data'][0]['url']`, but the response had `url` at the top level, not nested in a `data` array.

**Solution:**
Modified `OpenAIImageProvider::generateImage()` to return the response in the correct structure that matches what AI Imagen expects:

```php
return [
    'data' => $response['data'], // Keep original data array structure
    'created' => $response['created'] ?? time(),
    'model' => $payload['model']
];
```

This preserves the original OpenAI API response structure which already has the `data` array with image objects.

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/src/Providers/OpenAIImageProvider.php` (lines 89-95)

### Issue #3: Stats Tracking ✅

**Status:** Already working correctly from previous fix (v0.3.5)

AI Imagen properly reports usage to AI Core stats with:
```php
'tool' => 'ai_imagen'
```

The stats page correctly displays "AI Imagen" and "AI Scribe" labels.

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Clear Cache
- [ ] Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+F5)
- [ ] Clear WordPress object cache if using caching plugin
- [ ] Verify new version numbers are loaded

### 2. Test Model Dropdowns

#### OpenAI Provider
- [ ] Navigate to AI Imagen page
- [ ] Select "Openai" from provider dropdown
- [ ] Verify model dropdown shows:
  - `gpt-image-1`
  - `dall-e-3`
  - `dall-e-2`
- [ ] All three models should be visible

#### Gemini Provider
- [ ] Select "Gemini" from provider dropdown
- [ ] Verify model dropdown shows:
  - `gemini-2.5-flash-image`
  - `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`
  - `imagen-3.0-generate-001`
  - `imagen-3.0-fast-generate-001`
- [ ] All four models should be visible

#### Grok Provider
- [ ] Select "Grok" from provider dropdown (if configured)
- [ ] Verify model dropdown shows:
  - `grok-2-image-1212`

### 3. Test Image Generation

#### OpenAI Test
- [ ] Select "Openai" provider
- [ ] Select "dall-e-3" model
- [ ] Enter prompt: "A professional photo of a modern office workspace"
- [ ] Click "Generate Image"
- [ ] Verify image displays in preview area
- [ ] Verify image is not broken/empty
- [ ] Check browser console for "Generation response:" log
- [ ] Verify response shows `image_url` with actual URL

#### Gemini Test
- [ ] Select "Gemini" provider
- [ ] Select "gemini-2.5-flash-image" model
- [ ] Enter prompt: "A beautiful landscape with mountains and a lake"
- [ ] Click "Generate Image"
- [ ] Verify image displays in preview area
- [ ] Check browser console for any errors
- [ ] Verify response shows `image_url` with data URL (base64)

### 4. Test Browser Console Logs

Check for these console logs:
- [ ] "Models response:" - should show array of models
- [ ] "Generation response:" - should show response with image_url
- [ ] No JavaScript errors
- [ ] No "No models found" errors

### 5. Test AI Core Stats

- [ ] Generate 2-3 images with different providers
- [ ] Navigate to AI-Core > Statistics
- [ ] Verify "AI Imagen" appears in usage stats
- [ ] Verify provider breakdown shows correct providers
- [ ] Verify model usage is tracked

### 6. Test Settings Page (AI Core)

- [ ] Navigate to AI-Core > Settings
- [ ] Scroll to "Test Prompt" section
- [ ] Select "Image Generation" type
- [ ] Select a provider (OpenAI or Gemini)
- [ ] Verify model dropdown shows image models
- [ ] Enter a test prompt
- [ ] Click "Run Test"
- [ ] Verify image generates and displays correctly

## Technical Details

### Response Structure Comparison

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// OpenAI Provider returned:
{
    url: "https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/...",
    revised_prompt: "...",
    size: "1024x1024",
    quality: "hd",
    model: "dall-e-3"
}

// AI Imagen tried to access:
response['data'][0]['url']  // ❌ undefined
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// OpenAI Provider now returns:
{
    data: [
        {
            url: "https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/..."
        }
    ],
    created: 1234567890,
    model: "dall-e-3"
}

// AI Imagen accesses:
response['data'][0]['url']  // ✅ works!
```

### Model List Logic

**Before (Broken):**
1. Fetch all models from AI Core API (returns text models)
2. Filter for image capability
3. Add defaults only if filtered list is empty
4. Result: Missing primary image models

**After (Fixed):**
1. Return hardcoded list of known image generation models
2. No API call needed
3. Always returns correct models
4. Result: All image models available

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Model list is hardcoded**: If providers add new image models, the code needs to be updated
2. **No dynamic model discovery**: Unlike text models, image models are not fetched from provider APIs
3. **Gemini models**: Only models with `-image` suffix can generate images; standard models (without suffix) cannot

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** using the checklist above
2. **Verify all providers** work correctly (OpenAI, Gemini, Grok)
3. **Check console logs** for any errors or warnings
4. **Test stats tracking** to ensure usage is recorded
5. **Report any issues** found during testing
