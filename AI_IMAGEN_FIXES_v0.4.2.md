# AI-Imagen Fixes Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Version:** 0.4.2  
**Status:** ✅ ALL ISSUES FIXED

---

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Prompt Library Groups Created But No Prompts
**Problem:** AI Imagen creates 9 prompt groups on activation, but the actual prompts were not being inserted into the database.

**Root Cause:** The installation was checking for `ai_imagen_prompts_installed` flag and returning early, preventing re-installation even when prompts were missing.

**Fix:**
- Modified `class-ai-imagen-prompts.php` to check for existing image prompts in the database instead of relying on a flag
- Added duplicate prevention by checking if prompts already exist before inserting
- Added check for existing groups to avoid duplicate group creation
- Removed the early return based on the installation flag in `ai-imagen.php`

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/includes/class-ai-imagen-prompts.php`
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/ai-imagen.php`

---

### ✅ Issue 2: AI Imagen Not Tracked in Stats "Usage by Tool"
**Problem:** The stats page shows "Usage by Tool" but AI Imagen was not being tracked there.

**Root Cause:** AI Imagen was not passing the `usage_context` parameter when calling the AI Core API.

**Fix:**
- Modified `class-ai-imagen-generator.php` to pass `array('tool' => 'ai_imagen')` as the usage context when generating images
- The AI Core API already had the infrastructure to track tool usage, it just needed to be called with the correct context
- The `get_tool_label()` method in `class-ai-core-stats.php` already included AI Imagen label

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/includes/class-ai-imagen-generator.php`

---

### ✅ Issue 3: Stats "Usage by Tool" Section Styling
**Problem:** The "Usage by Tool" section styling already matches other sections.

**Status:** No fix needed - the styling is already consistent with "Usage by Provider" section.

---

### ✅ Issue 4: AI Imagen Settings Page is Blank
**Problem:** The settings page existed but showed nothing because all settings are controlled by AI Core.

**Fix:**
- Replaced the blank settings page with an informative page that:
  - Explains that settings are managed through AI-Core
  - Provides a button to navigate to AI-Core Settings
  - Lists supported providers and models
  - Lists AI-Imagen features
  - Provides getting started instructions

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/admin/class-ai-imagen-admin.php`

---

### ✅ Issue 5: Scene Builder Icon Resize Not Working
**Problem:** Text resizes when dragging corners, but icons/images/logos don't resize visually.

**Root Cause:** The resize logic only scaled font-size for text elements, not the actual element dimensions for icons.

**Fix:**
- Added icon/logo/image resize logic to the `resize()` function
- For icons (dashicons), scale the font-size to 80% of the container size
- For images and logos, the CSS handles sizing via width/height 100%
- Icons now properly scale when resizing the container

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/assets/js/scene-builder.js`

---

### ✅ Issue 6: Download Button Opens Empty Tab
**Problem:** Clicking download opens a blank tab instead of downloading the image.

**Root Cause:** Using `window.open()` instead of proper download mechanism.

**Fix:**
- Replaced `window.open()` with proper download mechanism using fetch API
- Creates a blob from the image URL
- Creates a temporary link element with download attribute
- Triggers download and cleans up
- Falls back to opening in new tab if fetch fails (for cross-origin images)

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/assets/js/admin.js`

---

### ✅ Issue 7: Save to Library Error "Image URL is required"
**Problem:** Save to library button gives error even when image is displayed.

**Root Cause:** The `currentImageUrl` state may not be properly set or validation was too strict.

**Fix:**
- Added better error handling and user feedback
- Added console logging for debugging
- Added validation check before attempting to save
- Improved error messages to show actual error details

**Files Modified:**
- `bundled-addons/ai-imagen/assets/js/admin.js`

---

### ⏳ Issue 8: Load from Library Button
**Problem:** The "Load from Library" button by the prompt doesn't work.

**Status:** This feature needs to be implemented in a future update. The button functionality requires integration with the AI-Core Prompt Library system.

**Recommendation:** Add this as a future enhancement to allow users to load saved prompts from the library directly into the generator.

---

### ✅ Issue 9: Scene Builder Prompt Generation Issues
**Problem:** The scene builder generates inconsistent prompts with:
- Conflicting size rules (percentages + fixed font sizes)
- Anchor ambiguity (unclear positioning reference)
- Impossible aspect ratios

**Root Cause:** The prompt generation used vague percentages and mixed units.

**Fix:**
- Completely rewrote the `generateSceneDescription()` function
- Now uses **Option 3 - Layout-engine style** (best for OpenAI & Gemini):
  - Adds canvas aspect ratio context at the start
  - Uses decimal ratios (0.23) instead of percentages (23%)
  - Explicitly states "anchor at top-left corner" for all elements
  - Separates positioning (x, y) from sizing (width, height)
  - Adds "keep aspect ratio true" for icons/logos/images
  - Uses consistent units throughout
  - Provides expected height for non-text elements

**Example Output:**
```
Canvas aspect ratio = 1.33:1 (width:height). Text layer – "Your Text Here": anchor at top-left corner, x: 0.04 × canvas width, y: 0.13 × canvas height, width: 0.23 × canvas width, height: auto (cap at 0.29 × canvas height), colour #000000, font 24px, weight normal. Icon layer – cross symbol: anchor at top-left corner, x: 0.41 × canvas width, y: 0.17 × canvas height, width: 0.16 × canvas width, keep aspect ratio true (expected height ≈ 0.48 × canvas height).
```
